    "This chapter introduces the concept of a **socket**. This is something that will continue to come up, so is important to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, a socket is like a file handle--it provides access to the information, not the information itself. However, a socket is different in that it provides **two-way** communication for sending *and* recieving information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll use sockets to connect to a web server and get the contents of a web page. Different from opening a file on disk, more coordination is needed between your computer and the web server to transmit data, confirm reciept of data, etc. Later, we'll use sockets to connect to databases. And again coordination and established protocols for sending and receiving data come into play.\n",

    "As described in the text, in order for two computers to communicate successfully, they need to be following some protocol, or established proceedures for communicating. HTTP is one protocol. We looked briefly at the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) earlier in the semester for transfering files from our computers to the cluster. Other protocols you may be familiar with include Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) all used for email systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many protocols for different types of communications, the important thing is that you need to establish which protocol is being used and follow the specifications of that protocol.\n",
