    " Ch. 14: Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of object-oriented programming is maybe one of the more computer sciency things that we will get into. Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been around since the 1960s and gained popularity most notably in the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Py4E text mentions, OOP provides another mechanism to abstract and compartmentalize the functions of your program, making it easier to work with large programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key concept in OOP is the idea of **classes** and **objects**. A class is a definition of a data format and methods that can be performed. For example the string class defines that way text is stored in a string and the methods are methods like the `.upper()`, `.strip()`, etc. that the string class can perform on strings. An instance of a class is called an object. So something like `x='Hello'` create and object, or instance of the string class, called `x` containing the data \"Hello\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not that I think we need to talk on the level of a 6-year-old (or that I think the average 6-years-old would actually understand this article), I think Alexander Petkov's article [How to explain object-oriented programming concepts to a 6-year-old](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/) provides a nice introduction with helpful diagrams eplaining the key concepts of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key object-oriented programming concepts include:\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: The concept that binds together the data and the functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#Encapsulation)).\n",
    "  * The idea here is that by making an object to hold both the data associated with the object and the functions that act on the data, these data and functions are somewhat isolated from the rest of the code and can be managed as a discrete entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction**: We've used this throughout the semester, trying to take a big problem, like driving to the grocery store and breaking it down into the component pieces. The parking in a parking space piece doesn't really need to know the details of the stopping at a red light on the way. Similarly, an we don't need to know how a string object takes a string and returns an upper case version of it--we just need to know that it can do this and how to use that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: Objects are often very similar. Earlier we used the idea of parking a car in the parking lot is similar to parking a car at home and how you might use the same code and extend it to add the new features. With inheritance, we can create a class (a child class) that inherits the data definitions and methods from another (parent) class. The child class can then be extended to add new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**: Is the condition of occurrence in different forms. Pylomorphism is used at different levels and we've used polymorphic operators and functions:"
